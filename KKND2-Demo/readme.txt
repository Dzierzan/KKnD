INGAME MENU
-----------
Either Press ESC or click on the bottom menu button to bring up the ingame menu.


SAVING AND LOADING GAMES
------------------------
To Save a Game:
* Either press F4, or bring up the ingame menu and click on the SAVE GAME button.
* To select a different slot just click on one.
* Once you have the right slot selected either click on the slot again, or press
the SAVE button.
* The game will now be saved.

To Load an Existing Game:
* Either press F3, or bring up the ingame menu and click on the LOAD GAME button.
* To select a different slot just click on one.
* Once you have the right slot selected either click on the slot again, or press
the LOAD button.
* The game now appears at the point it was saved

MOUSE CONTROLS
--------------
Left Mouse Button:  
* Selection of units: Click individual units or click and drag to select multiple 
units
* Add Unit unit to group: Hold SHIFT and click individual units
* Move: Click a point on the map and selected units will go there
* Attack: Click on enemy unit or structure and selected units will attack it
* Force Attack: hold ALT then click to attack a non-specific area or an allied unit
* Set Way point: Hold shift and click multiple points on the map to set a series of 
movements/attacks/etc.

Right Mouse Button
* Deselect:  Cancels all current selections
* Fast Scroll:  Hold and drag to move quickly over the map
* Cancel Production:  Click on queued unit buttons to cancel one queued unit. Hold [Ctrl] and click RMB to cancel all production.


CREATING BUILDINGS
------------------
To create a building, click on the sidebar.  A stippled image of the building will 
then replace the cursor.  Click this on the map area where you wish to build and 
the building will begin constructing itself.

Notes:
* More buildings/towers become available through increasing the Tech Level of other 
buildings (see Tech Levels below)
* If any part of the stippled image is red, it means that production on that area 
is not possible.  Red areas could indicate an obstruction or the fact that your 
building is too far away from the other buildings of your camp.  
* Blue areas on the stippled image indicate a valid area, though due to 
perspective, it only looks like it isn't valid.  In this case, just lay down the 
darn building as per usual, and it's all systems go!


PRODUCING UNITS
---------------
You produce units by clicking on the production buttons on the sidebar.  The 
produced units will appear at the front of their relevant building when ready.

Notes:  
* You can queue production by clicking on the button several times.  Ten clicks 
sets up 10 units to produce, an extra click sets the button to infinite - the unit 
will continually produce, resources willing.  
* Shortcut:  Hold CTRL and left click a production button to set it instantly 
to infinite.  Hold CTRL and right click a production button to cancel all 
queued production.
* More units become available with building upgrades (see Tech Levels below)
* To produce units, you will need the relevant building, eg. Barracks to produce 
infantry, Machine Shop to produce vehicles, etc.
* To see which building the units will be built from, hold your cursor over the
toolbar.  A text box will appear over the production building.  Additionally, 
hold ALT and click on the production button to centre the screen on the 
production building.


PRODUCING CONSTRUCTIBLES
------------------------
Constructibles are 'Do It Yourself' units.  There are 3 different bases which each 
army can choose from, and a variety of different 'turrets' to equip them with (note 
that a 'turret' is not necessarily an offensive addition - a 'turret' might simply 
be an armour turret or a speed turret or the like).  

Here's how they work:

* When you are at the correct Tech Level to allow Constructibles, the Constructible 
Button will activate on the sidebar.  Click it.
* You'll be presented with a bucketload of options.  First select a small, medium 
or large chassis (each has a different carrying capacity)
* Then select one or more 'turrets' from the adjacent menu.  Note that each button, 
when the cursor is over it, displays the 'turret's' name, cost and size value.  
Each chassis can carry up to its own size value in 'turrets', so multiple small 
'turrets' for one large chassis is possible.
* When the chassis and 'turret(s)' are selected, click on one of the blue buttons 
to the right of the chassis menu.  This sets that one button as a shortcut to 
produce that particular vehicle configuration.
* Now click on that shortcut to produce the unit (multiple units can be queued).
* Future vehicles of that configuration can be produced by simply clicking the 
shortcut.


TECH LEVELS
-----------
Tech Levels determine the type of units, structures and functions available at any 
one time.  There are two types of Tech Level:  Global and Local.  

Global:
The Global Tech Level is the ceiling of technology in each mission.  You will only 
be able to upgrade as far as the mission's Global Tech Level allows.  This Global 
level increases as you work your way through the missions, from basic level in 
Mission 1 through to full Tech by about Mission 8 or so (in the final game).

Local:
The Local Tech level is the current level of technology for each building.  Local 
Tech Level can be increased up to the maximum set by the Global Tech Level.

Increasing Local Tech Level:
First up, you'll need a Research Lab or the like.  Construct this building.  Then 
it's just a matter of clicking on the Research Lab (the cursor will change to a 
'Research' cursor) and clicking on the building you want researched.  When the 
research is complete, your building will be upgraded.  More options may now have 
opened up, including extra units, towers and walls.



SELECTING UNITS (and storing them)
---------------
* Units are selected using the Left Mouse Button.  See 'Mouse Controls' above.
* To store units as presets, first select the units, then hold CTRL and select a 
number from 1-0 on the main section of your keyboard (ie. not the numeric pad).  
This group, in future, can now be accessed simply by pressing the selected number 
key.



********************************************************************

MOVING & ATTACKING:
-------------------

For the most part, see 'Mouse Controls' above. 

Moving notes:
* Infantry can move over solid ground, shallow water and through dense trees.  They 
can also pile into aerial transports and be carried through the air.
* Only infantry can move through dense trees
* Amphibious units can travel over land and water, but cannot 'drop in' from cliffs
* Aerial units travel through the air (surprisingly enough) and land vertically.  
They don't roll along the ground.

Attacking notes: 
* There are a few ways to attack things.  One is to left click on an enemy, and 
your unit (if it can) will shoot something at it.
* The Squish:  Large units can squish smaller units simply by moving over them.  
Only infantry sized units can be squished, and note that Series 9 infantry cannot 
be squished!  They are too well armoured.
* Suicide Bombing:  A particular unit (Suicide Bomber or equivalent) can be sent 
somewhere to explode
* Automatic attacking:  This applies to towers and the like, which will fire at any 
enemy unit within range. 



********************************************************************

THE MINI MAP:
-------------

A miniature map shows you the whole battlefield in one bite-sized chunk.  This map 
is available after the Outpost (or equivalent) is upgraded once.  A button appears 
at the bottom right of the sidebar; click on it to see the map.

At the first level of tech, the map displays only the background you've uncovered 
and your own units.  Upgrading the Outpost again activates the higher tech map.  
This map includes enemy units as well.



********************************************************************

RESOURCES:
----------

You need resources to build stuff.  KKND2 allows for two types of resource income 
per army.  Everyone still has access to oil, but now there are alternative sources 
of energy, such as windmills and solar panels to provide constant (albeit smaller) 
energy revenue.  So let's get our hands dirty, so to speak.


GETTING OIL
-----------
* Build an Oil Derrick (or the equivalent; it's an Oil Rig maker)
* Find an Oil Puddle.
* Click on the Derrick, then click on the puddle (you should see the cursor change 
to a Deploy cursor).  This will set up a Rig over the puddle and start sucking oil.
* Build a Power Station, which will pump out a Tanker upon completion.
* The Tanker should automatically start shuttling oil between the Rig and the Power 
Station, though sometimes it needs to be told (click on the Tanker and click on the 
Rig - it'll figure the rest out).

Note:  
* You can't build too close to an oil puddle.  The smell's terrible, for one thing.

Further Note:  
* The Power Station can now be upgraded (via the Research Lab or equivalent) to improve 
its efficiency.  This will allow a higher resource intake per load of oil.


ALTERNATIVE POWER SOURCES
-------------------------
These are freestanding resource generators.  They function in the same way as 
buildings, so set them up and, once constructed, they'll start functioning, 
increasing your resource level gradually over time.  Note that there are two 
different levels of Alternative Resources available, the more advanced one costing 
more and only being available at higher Tech Levels, but also producing more 
resources over a shorter time.

Note: 
* Only four of each type of alternative resource can exist at any one time.


********************************************************************

SINGLE PLAYER GAMING:
---------------------

To start a single player game:

* Press the NEW GAME button on the main screen.  
* You'll be asked to select an army from the three presented.  Pick one.  
* You'll then be presented with the campaign map screen.  You'll be able to select 
one of the missions adjacent to your position.
*  You'll receive a mission briefing, then you'll begin!

Note:
* You can play a single player game on a multiplayer map against computer 
opponents.  This is called Kaos Mode, and is referred to in the Multiplayer Gaming 
section below.  


********************************************************************

MULTIPLAYER GAMING:
-------------------

This is where you get to smack up a friend or friends (or, let's face it, enemies) 
via a modem, IPX network or Null Modem cable.  

And here's how you do it.

* Select Multiplayer from the main menu
* Enter a name for yourself in the Name box
* Select the type of connection you'll be using (TCP/IP, IPX, Modem, Serial or 
NoFriends(No Network)).
* Select whether you'll be hosting a game or joining a game hosted by someone 
else.

The player who is the server has access to the following options on the 
multiplayer screen.

RUs: This button cycles through the starting resources, from 2000-15000 RUs.
CPU DIFF: This button changes the difficulty level of the computer controlled
opponents.
MAX TECH: Sets the maximum tech level for the multiplayer game, from 1-5.   
BUNKERS: Turns on the tech bunkers in the multiplayer game.
UNIT STATS: Cycles through the available unit statistics files that have been
created in the unit editor.
OIL AVAIL: Changes the amount of oil in each oil patch. From scarce to infinite.
FOG: Cycles through the avialable Fog and Shroud combinations.
VICTORY: Sets the victory conditions, these can be either Death Match (last 
team standing) or Ally Win (Allied Victory).
MAP: Cycles through the available maps.  This will also include an custom maps 
that all players have on their machines.
MAP DISPLAY: Displays the minimap of the selected multiplayer map.
START TYPE: Swaps between random starting positions or grouped starting 
positions.  The grouped starting option will place allied teams close together.

* Click the empty player slots to activate computer opponents (Kaos Mode).
Clicking on the player's race button will cycle through the different available 
races.
* Note: You can chat by clicking then typing in the Chat box.  Hit ENTER to send 
your message.
* Also note: You can pick alliances right up front by clicking on the number by 
your name until it cycles through to the same number as your would-be-ally.


Okay.  If you're Joining a game, you only have to click your race and colours.  If 
you are the host, then you can pick from the various options before starting the 
game.  Here's a few things you can do:


ALLYING DURING THE MULTIPLAYER GAME
-----------------------------------
Follow these steps to ally with another player during a multiplayer game:

* Click on the alliances button on the toolbar. This button shows the current
alliances in the game as a series of team logos, one for each player.  To ally
with a player, simply click on that players logo.  Hold your mouse over the logo
to show the player's name.



********************************************************************

THE NEW BITS:
-------------
Some of this has been covered above, but here's the basic list of new stuff for 
those who know about KKND1 or KKND Xtreme:


* TRANSPORTS:  Available as both an Aerial unit and as part of a non-aerial 
Constructible, the Transports can carry units and/or vehicles in a comfortable, 
more armoured manner.  To load a Transport, select the desired units, then click on 
the Transport.  The units will pile in.  To unload a Transport, make sure it's landed, 
then press the 'U' key on the keyboard.  Note:  Make sure there's enough space for 
the units to leave the vehicle, otherwise they simply won't.

* CONSTRUCTIBLE VEHICLES:  Accessible via the Constructible Unit button on the 
sidebar (when you're at a high enough Tech Level), Constructible vehicles allow you 
to create custom vehicles from a variety of chassis, weapons and other goodies.  
See under The Basics: Producing Constructibles for details on how to make this 
happen.

* AERIAL UNITS:  More than just for one-off bombing runs, the KKND2 Aerial units 
provide fighters, multiple-use bombers and unit transports.  Fighters behave as any 
standard unit.  Bombers, for the most part, behave as you'd expect, only after 5 
bombing passes, they automatically return to your base to reload.

* AMPHIBIOUS UNITS:  Units which can travel across both land and water, amphibious 
units open up the seas to the KKND player.  They function in the same way as 
standard units.

* GUARD TOWERS:  An extra tower per army, an anti-aircraft tower, has been added to 
take care of the new, pesky aerial units.

* RECYCLING:  Buildings can now be recycled.  To recycle, click the icon (towards 
the bottom of your sidebar) and then click on the desired building.  It will be 
deconstructed, and you'll be refunded a percentage of the original cost.  

* MOBILE REPAIRS:  A repair vehicle can repair other vehicles on the go - no need 
to haul a spluttering vehicle back to the base.

* SMART SELECTION:  Sick of group selecting a ton of units and sending them to face 
some attackers, only to find that your tanker has followed them halfway across the 
map and is now taking damage without giving any?  Smart selection takes care of 
that.  With Smart Selection active, tankers and buildings will not be selected as 
part of a drag selection.  Note that a force select (CTRL + drag) will select 
tankers and buildings, and individual clicks will always select the unit.

* WAY POINTS:  You can now supply multiple orders to units.  For example, tell a 
unit or group to move over here, then  over here (to attack from the rear), then 
attack, then return to base for repairs.  To use Way Points, select the unit or 
group and, while holding SHIFT, click on the multiple areas you require.  Note:  

* WALLS: As your Tech Level increases, you'll be able to build Walls.  Two types 
are available for each army, both are constructed in a similar way to buildings.  
The LoTech Wall provides a physical barrier.  Click on the LoTech Wall button, and 
the cursor will change to represent a stippled version of a section of wall.  Lay 
down as many sections as you like, and they will slowly construct.  HiTech Walls 
form electric barriers.  Set up one tower, then set up another in a horizontal or 
vertical line from the original, and a force field will go up  Multiple towers can 
be erected in a chain.  Note that these barriers only damage enemy units who pass 
through them, and will turn off briefly to allow passage of friendly/allied units.

* ORDERS LIST:  Units can be given various orders, such as Patrol and Scatter.  The 
F1 key displays al list of all of the keyboard shortcuts in the game.

* ARMOURY BUILDING: The Armoury Building is now responsible for Towers; upgrading 
it will give you access to higher Tech Level towers.  The Armoury buildings also 
increases the armour level of units produced after its construction. 

FOG OF WAR:  An option in the game, Fog of War allows for a higher level of 
strategy.  The map shows black areas, which represent areas that have not been 
viewed by the army.  Foggy grey areas show terrain and buildings that existed in 
that area the last time a friendly unit was there to have a look.  Up to the minute 
news of what's happening is only possible if a unit is physically within range of 
that area.

* GAME SPEED:  The game speed can be adjusted from the in game options menu or by 
pressing the [+] and [-] keys.

* SCROLL SPEED:  Changes to the settings for the scroll speed are possible via 
the in-game Options menu.

* UNIT EDITOR:  This will allow customising of unit attributes, such as Rate of 
Fire, Hit Points and the like.

* MINIMUM RANGES:  Some units will now have minimum ranges, allowing daring units 
to get in close to the big guns and take them apart in a very unstable kind of 
safety.

* SCORING:  At the end of each game (single or multiplayer), a scoring screen will 
appear, displaying units lost, enemy units killed, etc.  

* TECH BUNKERS:  Though similar to the Tech Bunkers in KKND1, the new look Tech 
Bunkers can only be opened by Technicians or their equivalent.  But now they could 
contain an even larger variety of strange weaponry!

* NEW BUILDINGS:  For details, see Appendix A: Buildings.

* NEW UNITS: For details, see Appendix A:  Infantry/Vehicles/Aerial Units.



********************************************************************

IN-GAME OPTIONS:
----------------

The in-game options menu allows you to change the following options:

* SmartSelect (On/Off)
* Wait at waypoints (On/Off)
* Music Volume
* Sound Effects Volume
* Scroll Speed
* Fast Scroll Speed
* Game Speed



********************************************************************

RESEARCH (UPGRADE) EFFECTS:
---------------------------

Increasing Tech Levels of buildings increases the Tech Level of units it can 
produce, its production/processing speed, and other good stuff.  For more detail on 
what Tech Levels are about, look at the Tech Level section above.

Listed here are the effects of upgrades on each building type:


UPGRADING OUTPOST/CLAN HALL/BARN
* First level Radar Map; Build Repair Bay
* Second level Radar Map; Build LoTech Wall
* Third level radar map; Build first level Alternative Power collectors
* Build HiTech Wall
* Build second level Alternative Power collectors


UPGRADING BARRACKS/WARRIOR HALL/MICROUNIT FACTORY
Each upgrade of this structure increases the choice of infantry units.


UPGRADING ARMOURY/ARMOURY/WEAPON CONTROL
Upgrading this structure increases the choice of 'turrets' available for 
Constructible Vehicles.

* Build Guard Tower level 1; Small APC
* Build Guard Tower level 2; Radar Turret
* Build Guard Tower level 3; Plazma/Acid/Flame Turrets; Anti-Aircraft Turret; Repair 
Turret
* Build Guard Tower level 4; Artillery Weapon; Large APC; Stealth/Arrow/Laser Turret
* Emp/Frenzy/Shield Turret; Sonic Boom Turret; Localised 
Temporal Anomaly Turret

Note:
Some Constructible options only available coupled with upgrades of the Machine Shop


UPGRADING MACHINE SHOP/BEAST ENCLOSURE/MACROUNIT FACTORY
Each upgrade of this structure increases the choice of vehicles.

* Additional vehicles; Small Constructible Base; Constructible 'Speed' option
* Additional vehicles; Armour Turret; Radar Jam Turret
* Additional vehicles; Medium Constructible Base
* Additional vehicles; Self Destruct Turret
* Additional vehicles; Large Constructible Base; Self Repair Turret

Note:
Some Constructible options are only available with concurrent upgrades of the 
Armoury


UPGRADING RESEARCH LAB/ALCHEMY HALL/TECHNOSTUDY
Each upgrade on this building will result in future upgrades to any building being 
completed in a progressively shorter time and at a cheaper rate.


UPGRADING POWER STATION/POWER STATION/POWER STATION
Each upgrade on this building will make oil refining a progressively more efficient 
operation.  Each haul of oil holds 400 Resource Units of oil, but at maximum Tech, 
the refining process can squeeze 500 Resource Units from each load.


UPGRADING REPAIR BAY/HEALING TENT/MAINTENANCE DEPOT
Each upgrade on this building will increase its efficiency.  It will repair/heal 
more cheaply and at a faster rate.

********************************************************************
ADVANCED SETTINGS

The first time you run KKND2 a configuration file is generated in the KKND2 directory.
This "options.cfg" file contains the settings for the options as well as some additional 
fields.  

WARNING: No tech support will be given for any problems that arise from changing the 
settings in this file.  

MINIMAP_WIDTH & MINIMAP_HEIGHT- You can modify the size of the ingame minimap. These 
values are in pixels.
MAX_UNITS- If you have more than 16 Meg of RAM you can change this value to give you
more units on each team. This however, can affect the speed of the game.
SCREEN_MODE - This can be set to 0, 1 or 2. 
i.e- (640 by 480), (800 by 600) or (1024 by 768). This will also affect the speed of
the game, but it gives you a larger viewing range.

Note:
(1) If you delete this file the next time the game runs it will generated again with
default options.
(2) If you edit a field and give it a value it doesn't like it will set it back
to a default value.
(3) In the KKND directory, there is a program called "options.exe".  This provides an
interface for changing the settings in the "options.cfg" file.
